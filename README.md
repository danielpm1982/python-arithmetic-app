[**Description of this repository**]<br>
This is a simple arithmetic app, created with Python 3, that simply demonstrates the basic syntax of this programming language. This app is a console program, and the user interface is basically a while loop through which the user chooses what arithmetic operations to call on a list of numbers passed by the same user in the sequence. In version v.1.0.0, the app demonstrates how to use modules, exception handling, conditional logics, data structures, input validation, functional programming and other basic structures. In version v.2.0.0, the app is completely refactored to show up how to implement the same project using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), instead of modules. In this later version, more advanced Python features are demonstrated, as class instantiations, properties' decorators for managing accessor methods, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, instance and static variables and methods, etc.
